# Senti-Watcher
Villanova Computer Science Senior Project by Ava, Jason, and Justin

## Background 
Studies suggest that stock prices rise with positive sentiment and fall with negative sentiment, so we created Senti-Watcher: An application that allows users to choose a ticker and time period and view the correlation between the media sentiment of a publicly traded company and equity price movement. Knowing the sentiment expressed about a company creates informed decision-making in investing and increased awareness of market factors.
