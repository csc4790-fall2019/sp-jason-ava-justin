## Background
Studies suggest that stock prices rise with positive sentiment and fall with negative sentiment, so we created **Senti-Watcher**: An application that allows users to choose a ticker and time period and view the correlation between the media sentiment of a publicly traded company and equity price movement. Knowing the sentiment expressed about a company creates informed decision-making in investing and increased awareness of market factors.
